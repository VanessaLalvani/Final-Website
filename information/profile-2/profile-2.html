        <h2 class="subheading-2"> background</h2>
        <p class="body-2"> 
            little is known about franklin's early years, but he is known to have been born in los 
            angeles on August 30, 1952 and to have been raised in South Central L.A. He was married 
            to a Belizean woman, Sylvia, with whom he had two children, and has served in the U.S. 
            Army, receiving a general discharge in 1975. During his murder trial, he was accused of 
            taking part in the gang-rape of a 17-year-old girl in Stuttgart while he was stationed 
            there in 1974. He worked as a garbage collector for the Los Angeles Department of Sanitation
            during the time of his killings. He lived in Los Angeles and was retired at the time of his
            arrest. He had a criminal record dating back to 1989, consisting of two charges of possession
            of stolen property in 1993 and 2003, one charge of misdemeanor assault in 1999, and one of
            misdemeanor battery in 1997.

        <p class="body-2-1"> 
            Franklin served time in prison for one of the stolen property charges, but was arrested on other
            charges several times in his life; his first arrest was for auto theft in 1969 when he was 16,
            but he was also arrested for burglary and firearm offenses. Franklin was a very able mechanic 
            and even worked as one at the 77th Street police station for some time. He often helped neighbors 
            and friends as a local handyman, especially with car repairs.

        <h2 class="subheading-3"> murders</h2>
        <p class="body-3"> 
            The first of ten murder victims attributed to Franklin was found on August 15, 1985 in South Los 
            Angeles, California. Her name was Deborah Jackson and she was employed as a cocktail waitress. 
            Over the following three years, Franklin (by then dubbed the Grim Sleeper) attacked eight more 
            women. They coincided with the serial killings of several other prostitutes in the area, which 
            were believed to have been committed by a single man nicknamed "The Southside Slayer". When the 
            last Sleeper victim of that time, Enietra Margette Washington, was attacked but survived on November 
            20, 1988, and was able to give an accurate description of the killer and his car, Franklin is believed 
            to have stopped killing. After remaining inactive for 13-14 years.

        <p class="body-3-1"> 
            Franklin struck again, killing 
            Princess Berthomieux, a 15-year old runaway who had resorted to prostitution. She was found dead in 
            March 2002, three months after her disappearance on December 21, 2001. Unlike the prior victims, she 
            was strangled instead of being shot. Back on the hunt, Franklin killed again in 2003 and in 2006 or 
            2007. In 2007, investigators linked DNA from her body to the prior Sleeper murders.

        <h2 class="subheading-4"> methods of murder</h2>
        <p class="body-4"> 
            Franklin targeted African-American women aged in their teens to mid-thirties. Some of them were 
            prostitutes. He would usually pick them up, either by force or, if they were prostitutes, by 
            soliciting them, rape them, taking photos of them with a Polaroid camera while he did so, and kill 
            them by shooting them in the chest with a Titan FIE .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol. When Franklin 
            started killing again in the 2000s, he would kill them by strangling them to death after raping them, 
            only using a gun for his final known murder. The victims' bodies would be dumped in trash dumpsters or 
            dumped in alleys in the south side of Los Angeles and then covered with trash.

        <h2 class="subheading-5"> arrest</h2>
        <p class="body-5"> 
            In 2009, they matched it partially to the DNA of Christopher Franklin, who had a criminal record in the form
            of a weapons charge. Further analysis showed that it belonged to his father, who was Franklin. After trailing 
            Franklin, the LAPD extracted a DNA sample from a slice of pizza left behind by him at a restaurant. Franklin 
            was arrested on July 7, 2010, after his sample was linked to the DNA on the Sleeper victims. He has been 
            formally charged with the ten confirmed Sleeper murders and the attempted murder.

        <p class="body-5-1"> 
            On December 16, 2010, the LAPD released a large collection of photos of women found in Franklin's home, hoping 
            to be able to identify them. They found a total of over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video recordings. 
            One photo was of Janecia Peters, Franklin's last known victim. Franklin also became a viable suspect in the 
            disappearances of three other women in the Los Angeles area over the years. Photos of two of the aforementioned missing 
            women were found in his home, as well as one of the victims' Nevada driver's license and the high school ID of another 
            missing victim.

        <h2 class="subheading-6"> conviction and death</h2>
        <p class="body-6">
            On February 16, 2016, after several delays, the trial against Franklin began. On May 5, 2016, he was convicted of all 
            counts and sentenced to death. On March 28th, 2020, Franklin was found in his cell at the San Quentin State Prison in 
            an unresponsive state and pronounced dead.
