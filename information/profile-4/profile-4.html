        <h2 class="subheading-1"> who was william devin howell?</h2>
        <p class="body-1"> 
            William Devin Howell is one of Connecticut’s most notorious serial killers, scouting out women and 
            getting them into his dark blue Ford Econoline van that he lived out of and referred to as the “murder 
            mobile”. He raped six and killed seven women inside of this van in 2003 and dumped the victim’s bodies 
            in a heavily wooded area behind a strip mall on Hartford Road in New Britain, CT. He called this area 
            his “garden” and knew it well, as he often parked his van at the edge of the parking lot by the dumping
            ground and slept there.

        </p>

        <h2 class="subheading-2"> victims</h2>
        <p class="body-2"> 
            The victims were identified as seven women, including one transgender woman, Janice Roberts. Their bodies were 
            discovered in two locations, including an area behind a shopping plaza on Hartford Road in New Britain, referred 
            to by Howell as his "garden". The person who discovered this principal body dump, at the start of 2005, by which 
            time the remains were mostly skeletal, had been looking for an area to hunt in. The ground is wooded and marshy and 
            inaccessible by car, which delayed the investigation and recovery of the victims. Most of the women that he murdered were 
            mothers, and many were dealing with substance abuse and addiction. He chose vulnerable women often in desperate 
            situations.

        <h2 class="subheading-3"> murders</h2>
        <p class="body-3"> 
            Arizmendi disappeared in July of 2003, but unlike the disappearances of his other victims—who investigators say 
            were often connected anonymously to Howell through drugs—this time there had been a witness

        </p>
        <p class="body-3-1"> 
            Arizmendi and her boyfriend invited to Howell visit their motel room while the three smoked crack together. Arizmendi’s 
            boyfriend would later tell police that she disappeared on July 25, 2003 after getting into the blue van of someone the 
            couple knew as "Devin" in a parking lot along Berlin Turnpike to get drugs, according to the court documents. Investigators 
            were able to track the van to Howell, who had his middle name “Devin” tattooed on his bicep. Inside, they made a chilling 
            discovery.

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-2"> 
            The back cushion of the van’s seat was stained with blood "soaking through the fabric into the foam underneath," while 
            another cushion had been removed and replaced with three sofa cushions. Although the blood was found to belong to Arizmendi
            and another unidentified person, without her body, prosecutors didn’t have enough evidence to prove she had been murdered 
            and Howell agreed to the lesser charge of manslaughter before the body could be recovered.

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-3"> 
            Howell would later tell author Anne K. Howard from prison that Arizmendi had wanted a ride to Hartford, but instead, he 
            had grabbed her, “raped her throughout the night and into the day,” before killing her and throwing her down the hill 
            into his makeshift “garden."

        <p class="body-3-4"> 
            The bodies of Diane Cusack, 53, Joyvaline Martinez, 23, and Mary Jane Menard, 40, were found by the hunter in 2007 but 
            the murders wouldn’t be linked to Howell until investigators got the break they needed from Howell’s fellow inmate Jonathan 
            Mills, a triple murderer himself who had befriended the former landscaper behind bars

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-5"> 
            Using details he had gleaned from his conversations with the killer, Mills drew police a detailed map of where the bodies 
            were buried and in April of 2015 investigators found the bodies of Arizmendi and three other victims—Melanie Ruth Camilini, 
            29; Marilyn Gonzalez, 26; and Danny Lee Whistnant, 44—in the same wooded area behind the shopping mall off Hartford Road.

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-6"> 
            Howell’s crimes were distinctive because of their savage and violent nature.
            <a href="https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/serial-killer-william-devin-howells-crimes-examined" class="cit1">(sederstorm)</a>

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-7"> 
            His cellmate told investigators that Howell’s first victim, Melanie Ruth Camilini, had been raped, strangled and hit in the 
            head with a hammer, according to his arrest warrant.

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-8"> 
            Howell told Howard in a series of jailhouse interviews that he only slept beside the body because he had “no choice” and 
            said he never called the corpse his “baby” but had confided in Mills that he had “slept beside the body,” according to an 
            excerpt of Howard’s book “His Garden: Conversations with a Serial Killer.”

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-9"> 
            In an effort to conceal her identity, Howell said he cut off the tips of Camilini’s fingers and dismantled the bottom portion 
            of her jaw before throwing the body parts in a dumpster behind The Dollar Store in Hartford and disposing of the rest of the 
            body in what would become his graveyard behind the busy New Britain strip mall.

        </p>

        <p class="body-3-10"> 
            In another slaying, Howell said he kidnapped Gonzalez and raped the 26-year-old throughout the night before stopping at McDonald’s 
            to get her a final meal—in what would become a strange ritual for the killer.

        </p>


        <h2 class="subheading-4"> motive</h2>
        <p class="body-4"> 
            Howell has insisted his motivation for the slayings was “never about the killing.”
            <a href="https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/serial-killer-william-devin-howells-crimes-examined" class="cit1">(sederstorm)</a>
        </p>

        <p class="body-4-1"> 
            “I just killed them to conceal the evidence,” he told Howard, according to her book. “I knew that once I raped them, they would 
            go to the cops and I’d end up back in jail. So I had to keep that from happening. I definitely didn’t enjoy killing them. As I 
            choked them out I was thinking—just hurry up and die.”

        </p>

        <p class="body-4-2"> 
            Although the Connecticut State Division of Criminal Justice was only able to link Howell to the rapes of three women, he admitted 
            to raping all his victims, except Whistnant—who he said he killed in a fit of rage after realizing the 44-year-old was transgender.

        <h2 class="subheading-5"> investigation and arrest</h2>
        <p class="body-5"> 
            Because Arizmendi's body was yet to be found, Howell was charged at that time with first degree manslaughter. Later, he was also 
            charged with witness tampering after threatening another inmate.[8] In January 2007, shortly after the trial began, Howell entered 
            an Alford plea to first degree manslaughter, meaning that he did not admit to the crime but conceded that the prosecution had enough 
            evidence to make a conviction likely.

        </p>
        <p class="body-5-1"> 
            At sentencing, Howell continued to insist that he did not kill Arizmendi, arguing that the blood stains were from a physical fight that 
            Arizmendi had in the van with her boyfriend. He also tried to get his Alford plea thrown out, claiming that he had only entered the plea 
            because his public defender pressured him. Howell was sentenced to 15 years in prison for manslaughter in the first degree.

        </p>

        <p class="body-5-2"> 
            Just weeks later, a hunter found human bones behind the WestFarms shopping mall in West Hartford. They were later identified as Cusack, 
            Martinez, and Menard. More remains were discovered on April 28, 2015, and they were identified as Arizmendi, Gonzalez, Camilini, and Whistnant.

        </p>

        <p class="body-5-3"> 
            Howell later told his cellmate that there was a monster inside of him and described himself as a "sick ripper," which led to Howell being 
            referred to as the Sick Ripper by some media outlets. He also told the inmate during a card game that he kept one of the women's bodies in 
            his van for two weeks because it was too cold outside to bury her. He slept next to her and called the victim his "baby." Howell later cut 
            off the tips of her fingers, dismantled her bottom jaw and disposed of the body parts in Virginia.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Devin_Howell" class="cit1">william devin howell</a>
        </p>

        <p class="body-5-4"> 
            On November 17, 2017, Howell was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to the murders of Cusack, Martinez, Menard, 
            Gonzalez, Camilini, and Whistnant. He cried and apologized to the families of the victims during sentencing, calling his actions "monstrous, 
            cowardly and selfish." He told the court that he deserved the death penalty, which was abolished by the Connecticut Supreme Court in 2015.
