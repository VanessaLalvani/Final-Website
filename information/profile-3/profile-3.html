        <h2 class="subheading-2"> background</h2>
        <p class="body-2"> 
            Vann was born in Indiana. He was married for 16 years to a woman who was about 30 years older 
            than him. He was reportedly arrested in Gary, Indiana for threatening the life of his girlfriend. 
            He was charged with a class D felony and spent 90 days in jail. Vann was previously convicted in 
            Travis County, Texas, of sexual assault and served five years in a state penitentiary, being released 
            on July 5, 2013.

        <h2 class="subheading-3"> murders</h2>
        <p class="body-3"> 
            Seven women, ranging in age from teenagers to a 53-year-old, were murdered in 2014, between January and October. 
            Their bodies were not discovered until Vann led authorities to their exact whereabouts. All of the women were 
            making a living as sex workers, and many were struggling with drug addiction.

        <p class="body-3-1"> 
            In January 2019, the city of Gary razed the abandoned buildings where the victims’ remains were discovered. 
            The Gary Mayor, Karen Freeman-Wilson, commented that the step might bring some consolation to the families and 
            that, “It’s the least the city can do,” according to the Northwest Indiana Times.

        <p class="body-3-2"> 
            Several of the women had been missing for nearly a year. The last victim, Afrikka Hardy, was just out of high 
            school when she met up with Vann through an escort service. It was the victim that helped police catch a serial killer.

        <h2 class="subheading-4"> abandoned buildings</h2>
        <p class="body-4"> 
            Vann murdered at least six more women and left their bodies in vacant buildings frequented by drug addicts. The escorts 
            Vann chose often struggled with drug addiction. According to The New York Times, Gary had 10,000 vacant buildings, many 
            of them residential, at the time Vann was killing women. The city has since made efforts to deal with the problem but is 
            overwhelmed with vacant homes due to a floundering economy and residents who’ve moved elsewhere for jobs the city can no 
            longer offer. The city of Gary has officially stated about 20% of residential homes are uninhabited. The other victims 
            were found in five separate boarded-up houses.

        <h2 class="subheading-5"> arrest and investigation</h2>
        <p class="body-5"> 
            When 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy was found strangled in a Motel 6, authorities used Hardy’s phone records and located Vann. 
            Upon apprehension, Vann was found to have possession of several key pieces of potential evidence which included Hardy’s phone.

        </p>
        <p class="body-5-1"> 
            During police interrogation he allegedly confessed to his involvement in Hardy’s killing and told police he was involved in 
            other killings. He is currently being held in Hammond, Indiana. His first court hearing was scheduled October 22, however he 
            was held in contempt of court. His next hearing was held on October 28 at Lake County Jail in Crown Point where he plead to 
            two charges of “not guilty” filed against him so far.

        <h2 class="subheading-6"> more bodies?</h2>
        <p class="body-6">
            The Murder Accountability Project was founded in 2015 by Thomas Hargrove, who uses data to identify clusters of homicides in 
            an attempt to link related murders by location, method, and other data. He’s developed an algorithm that can help predict whether 
            a serial killer might be operating in a given area.
            <a href="https://murderpedia.org/male.V/v/vann-darren.htm" class="cit1">(darren deon vann)</a>
        </p>

        <p class="body-6-1">
            In 2010, Hargrove contacted the Gary, Indiana police to tell them he believed a serial killer was operating there but received no 
            response. It wasn’t until 2014 that Vann murdered the seven known victims. When he was arrested for Hardy’s murder, he mentioned 
            he’d been killing for decades. For this reason, Hargrove, along with the coroner who examined the bodies of the seven murder victims 
            in Gary, believes Vann may have more victims.
            <a href="https://murderpedia.org/male.V/v/vann-darren.htm" class="cit1">(darren deon vann)</a>
        </p>

        <p class="body-6-2">
            During his confession to Hardy’s murder, and while he was detailing where the other six victims could be found, Vann made claims he’d 
            been murdering women since the 1990s. Given his long history of violence against women, authorities could solve several more cases 
            linked to Vann, who is now serving seven life sentences in the Wabash Valley Correctional Center.
